       <i>This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 15, 2022.</i>
       <p>Thank you for joining Star Classes. We at Star Classes (“Star Classes”, “we”, “us”) respect your privacy and want you to understand how we collect, 
        use, and share data about you. This Privacy Policy covers our data collection practices and describes your rights regarding your 
        personal data.</p>
        <p>
          Unless we link to a different policy or state otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies when you visit or use the Star Classes and 
          CorpU websites, mobile applications, APIs, or related services (the “Services”). It also applies to prospective customers of 
          our business and enterprise products.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</b> You shouldn’t use the Services if you don’t agree with this 
          Privacy Policy or any other agreement that governs your use of the Services.
        </p>

        <h4>1. What Data We Get</h4>
        <p class="">
          We collect certain data from you directly, like information you enter yourself, data about your consumption of content, 
          and data from third-party platforms you connect with Udemy. We also collect some data automatically, like information about 
          your device and what parts of our Services you interact with or spend time using. All data listed in this section is subject 
          to the following processing activities: collecting, recording, structuring, storing, altering, retrieving, encrypting, 
          pseudonymizing, erasing, combining, and transmitting.

                In order to use certain features (like accessing content), you need to create a user account, which requires 
                us to collect and store your email address, password, and account settings. To create an instructor account, we 
                collect and store your name, email address, password, and account settings. As you use certain features on the site, 
                you may be prompted to submit additional information including occupation, government ID information, verification photo, 
                date of birth, race/ethnicity, skill interests, and phone number. Upon account creation, we assign you a unique identifying number.

                instructors, or posting photos or other work you upload. Such shared content may be publicly viewable by others depending

        <h4>2. How We Get Data About You</h4>
        <p>We use tools like cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to gather the data listed above. Some of these tools 
          offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.
        </p>
        <b>2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools</b>
        <p>
          We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and share data about your activities 
          across websites, including on Udemy. They allow us to remember things about your visits to Star Classes, like your preferred language, 
          and to make the site easier to use. To learn more about cookies, visit https://cookiepedia.co.uk/all-about-cookies. We may also 
          use clear pixels in emails to track deliverability and open rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Star Classes and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party advertisers) use server log files 
          and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web 
          beacons (together, <b>“Data Collection Tools“</b>) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically 
          track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we 
          tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <b>2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools</b>
        <p>Star Classes uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Strictly Necessary:</u> These Data Collection Tools enable you to access the site, provide basic functionality 
            (like logging in or accessing content), secure the site, protect against fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or 
            unauthorized use of your account. These are required for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them, parts of the 
            site will break or be unavailable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Functional:</u> These Data Collection Tools remember data about your browser and your preferences, provide additional site 
            functionality, customize content to be more relevant to you, and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of 
            the Services (like your preferred language or volume level for video playback).
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Performance:</u> These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the Services by providing usage and performance data, 
            visit counts, traffic sources, or where an application was downloaded from. These tools can help us test different versions 
            of Star Classes to see which features or content users prefer and determine which email messages are opened.
          </li>
          <li>

        <h4>4. Who We Share Your Data With</h4>
        <p>
          We share certain data about you with instructors, other students, companies performing services for us, Star Classes affiliates, 
          our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run promotions 
          and surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for security, legal 
          compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified 
          or if we get your consent.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Security</h4>
        <p>
          We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, 
          there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect 
          any unauthorized access to your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Star Classes takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction 
          of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, 
          however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Star Classes, the Services, or any 
          information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access 
          by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. 
          You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, 
          you should change it immediately and contact our Support Team with any concerns.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Your Rights</h4>
        <p>
          You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection 
          of your data by certain third parties. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us 
          for individual rights requests about your personal data. Parents who believe we’ve unintentionally collected personal data about 
          their underage child should contact us for help deleting that information.

        <b>6.3 Our Policy Concerning Children</b>
        <p>
          We recognize the privacy interests of children and encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their 
          children’s online activities and interests. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, but of the required age for consent 
          to use online services where they live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), may not set up an account, but may have 
          a parent or guardian open an account and help them access appropriate content. Individuals younger than the required age for 
          consent to use online services may not use the Services. If we learn that we’ve collected personal data from a child under those 
          ages, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.
